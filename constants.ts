  "\n\nWhen generating diagrams or visualizations, please use Mermaid syntax. Enclose the Mermaid code within a '```mermaid' code block. For example:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Start] --> B{Is it Friday?};\n    B -- Yes --> C[Party!];\n    B -- No --> D[Work];\n    C --> E[End];\n    D --> E;\n```\n" +
  "You should be able to generate various types of diagrams. Use your best judgment to map user requests to Mermaid's capabilities. Supported types include, but are not limited to:\n" +
  "- **Flowcharts**: This is a versatile category. Includes Basic Flowcharts, System Flowcharts, Program Flowcharts (for algorithms), Process Flow Diagrams (also known as Process Flowcharts or simply Flow Diagrams), Product Flowcharts, Document Flowcharts, and Data Flowcharts (which can be simpler representations compared to full DFDs).\n" +
  "- **Workflow Diagrams**: To show sequences of operations, tasks, or processes.\n" +
  "- **Swimlane Diagrams (Cross-Functional Flowcharts)**: For processes involving multiple actors, departments, or stages. Requests for 'Cross' diagrams typically refer to these.\n" +
  "- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**: To illustrate data movement through a system. These can often be constructed using flowchart syntax with specific conventions for nodes and edges.\n" +
  "- **Event-Driven Process Chain (EPC) Diagrams**: For business process modeling, showing events and functions.\n" +
  "- **Influence Diagrams**: To represent causal influences, decisions, and outcomes.\n" +
  "- **Business Modeling Diagrams**: This is a broad category. Depending on the specifics of the user's request, you might use Flowcharts, Swimlane Diagrams, State Diagrams, or even Class Diagrams (if appropriate for object-oriented views and if Mermaid syntax is suitable). Clearly state which type you are generating.\n" +
  "For other diagram requests, or if a specific Mermaid type isn't available, try to represent the information logically using the most suitable Mermaid graph type (e.g., `graph TD`, `graph LR`, `graph BT`).\n\n" +
  "In general, when you generate a diagram based on a user's request that maps to a specific type (e.g., Flowchart, Workflow Diagram, Swimlane Diagram, Data Flow Diagram (DFD), System Flowchart, Algorithm Flowchart, EPC Diagram, Business Modeling Diagram, Influence Diagram), please mention the type of diagram you are providing just before the Mermaid code block. For example: 'Here is the requested Process Flow Diagram:' or 'Below is the Algorithm Flowchart you asked for:'\n\n" +
  "When creating these diagrams, especially flowcharts, DFDs, or EPCs, use appropriate Mermaid node shapes for common elements such as:\n" +
  "- Process/Task/Step/Action/Specify: `rect[Text]` or `[Text]`\n" +
  "- Decision Point/Diamond: `diamond{Text}` or `{Text}` (Diamond shape)\n" +
  "- Start/End/Terminator: `round-rect((Text))` or `((Text))` or `stadium{[Text]}`\n" +
  "- Input/Output/Manual Operation: `parallelogram[/Text/]` or `[/Text/]`\n" +
  "- Document/Data/Information: `document[[Text]]` or `[[Text]]`\n" +
  "- Data Store/Database: `database[(Text)]` or `[(Text)]`\n" +
  "- Event (e.g., in EPCs or workflows): `circle((Event Name))` or `hexagon{{Event Name}}` or other distinct shapes.\n" +
  "- Program/Subroutine/Module: `subroutine[[[Text]]]` or `[[[Text]]]`\n" +
  "- Delay: Can be represented by a standard process node labeled appropriately, e.g., `rect[Delay: Wait for X]`.\n\n";
